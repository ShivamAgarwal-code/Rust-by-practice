// A crate is a binary or library. the crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and
// makes up the root module of the crate.
// In package hello-package, there is a binary crate with the same name as teh package: hello-
// package, and src/main.rs is the crate root of this binary crate.
// Similar to hello-package, hello-package1 also has a crate in it, however, this package doesn't
// contain a binary crate but a library crate, and src/lib.rs is the crate root.
